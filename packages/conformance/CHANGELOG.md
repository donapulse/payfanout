# @payfanout/conformance

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- d68ccbb: Harden the adapter contract. Breaking: `capturePayment`, `cancelPayment`, and `verifyPaymentMethod` now REQUIRE an idempotency key (capture is the canonical double-charge operation; under multi-capture every partial capture carries its own key); `RefundRequest.reason` is typed to `"duplicate" | "fraudulent" | "requested_by_customer"`; capability guards reject with the new `unsupported_operation` code (previously `invalid_request`), expired stateless session tokens with the new `session_expired`; `authentication_required` is never retryable on any adapter; `withRetry`'s `maxDelayMs` is now a hard ceiling with jitter included.

  Additions: `AdapterCapabilities.supportedCurrencies` declares hard PSP currency constraints and the router/service pre-screen them (a PayPal-unsupported currency now skips to the next PSP instead of aborting the cascade); `PaymentInfo` reports `amountCaptured`, `amountCapturable`, and echoes `metadata` where the PSP supports it; `PaymentMethodDetails` carries `expMonth`/`expYear`; webhook events carry normalized `amount`, `currency`, and `refundId` where the payload does; `RetryPolicy.signal` cancels between attempts; new helpers `allocate` (lost-cent-free integer splits), `REFUND_STATUSES`/`RefundStatus`, `isUnifiedWebhookEventType`, `isUnifiedPaymentMethodType`, and the `DATA_PAYFANOUT_FIELD` slot constant.

  The conformance suite now proves the money paths on every adapter — retrieve truth, full/partial/over-refund behavior, pending-refund polling, capture and multi-capture amounts, clean cancellation, unknown-webhook mapping, per-code retryable semantics, and redirect-flow client adapters must implement `handleRedirectReturn`.

### Patch Changes

- 30d9a84: README refresh: correct the runner usage snippet to the real `(name, makeAdapter, fixtures)` signature, document the money-path coverage, and drop the stale "not yet published" notice.
- a016891: Adapter plumbing that existed as four-to-five drifting copies now lives once in `@payfanout/core`, and every adapter consumes it: the WebCrypto/base64 helper family (`hmacSha256`, `constantTimeEqual`, …, with the node:crypto bit-equivalence tests moved alongside), the REST transport primitives (`requestWithTimeout` with the timer covering the body read, `withTransportRetries`, `isTransportRetryable`, `safeJson`), the HTTP error tail (`classifyHttpFallback`), capability coherence (`validateAdapterCapabilities`, shared by `PaymentService` and the conformance suite), client SDK loading (`assertBrowser`, `injectScript`), and webhook utilities (`normalizeTime`, `lowercaseKeys`, `normalizeSecrets`). Behavior is unchanged apart from a few user-message strings converging on core's catalog text; all transport timing, retry, and edge-runtime guarantees are preserved and still guard-tested. Core remains zero-dependency and browser-safe.
