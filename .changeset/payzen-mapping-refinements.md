Refine PayZen mappings against the current provider references. CB refusal codes 34 and 41 map to `fraud_suspected` and 38 to `expired_card`; `CLIENT_305` and unmapped CLIENT_ codes map to a non-retryable `invalid_request` instead of a retryable `processing_error`; transactions in the temporary `INITIAL` state report `processing`; and reads normalize wallet transaction labels onto `paymentMethodType` where PayZen reports them, with unknown methods staying `other`.
