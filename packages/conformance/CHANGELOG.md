# @payfanout/conformance

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- d500d7d: Model push-only providers in the adapter contract. `AdapterCapabilities` gains three required fields — `supportsPaymentRetrieval`, `supportsRefundRetrieval` and `modificationOutcome` — `retrievePayment` becomes optional, and `PaymentService.retrievePayment` and `retrieveRefund` now reject with `unsupported_operation` when the provider exposes no such read (`retrieveRefund` previously guarded on refund support, which is a separate capability). A provider that only acknowledges captures, cancels and refunds reports `"processing"` and a `"pending"` refund instead of a terminal state it has not confirmed. Both retrieval flags are validated in both directions, so an implemented read cannot be declared absent. The adapters shipped before this release declare full payment and refund retrieval with synchronous modifications, so their behavior is unchanged. They take a major nonetheless: `getCapabilities()` is part of their public surface and now returns an object with additional required fields, and an adapter release that quietly required a new `@payfanout/core` major could leave an application resolving two copies of core.
- 8933b9f: Model what a webhook signature covers in the adapter contract. `AdapterCapabilities` gains a required `webhookSignatureScope: "raw-bytes" | "field-values"`. `"raw-bytes"` means the signature covers bytes as delivered, so any re-encoding of the signed byte range invalidates it; `"field-values"` means the provider signs selected values extracted from the payload, so a re-encoded body still verifies and fields outside the signed set arrive unauthenticated — such an adapter must authenticate the delivery channel by another means and must never present an unsigned field as trusted. `validateAdapterCapabilities` rejects an absent scope rather than letting it disable the assertion it gates. The conformance suite applies its re-serialized-body assertion under `"raw-bytes"` and inverts it under `"field-values"`, which must additionally supply a `webhook.tamperedSignedValueBody` fixture — one signed value altered, signature as delivered — and reject it; rejecting tampered content and credential-less deliveries is still required of every adapter. The adapters shipped before this release all sign raw bytes and declare `"raw-bytes"`, so their verification behavior is unchanged; they take a major because the capability object they return gained a required field.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- eed2987: The server suite now proves the PSP-native subscription surface, gated per declared capability: create round-trips a vaulted instrument into a valid record, retrieve resolves by id, listing honors `limit` and terminates through `nextCursor` without duplicate ids, statuses stay inside the unified union, and cancel is verified-idempotent — a repeated cancel must resolve as success. Adapters declaring any native-subscription operation supply the new `nativeSubscriptions` fixtures (`createInput`, or `seedSubscriptions` for providers without server-only create); all-false adapters skip the cases unchanged.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 80b9bb6: The capability suites now assert that any `countries` an adapter declares on a payment method are well-formed ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, on both the server and client halves. An adapter declaring malformed country codes will newly fail the suite — a malformed code never matches a session's `customerCountry`, silently screening the rail out instead of gating it.
- d1d42fa: The capability suites now assert that any `currencies` an adapter declares on a payment method are well-formed ISO 4217 codes, on both the server and client halves. An adapter whose method-level currency codes are malformed, or which offers a rail gated to currencies its `supportedCurrencies` excludes, will newly fail the suite — both cases silently disable the rail at routing time.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3be57b0: Add a declarative adapter onboarding descriptor and an optional credential probe.
  `@payfanout/core` exports `AdapterOnboardingDescriptor` — credential-field metadata (kind,
  scope, format hints, per-currency), the webhook signature scheme and event list, and CSP
  hosts — plus `validateOnboardingDescriptor`, and `ServerPaymentAdapter` gains an optional
  `verifyCredentials()` that reports whether the configured credentials authenticate (auth vs
  network vs internal). Every server adapter (Stripe, Paysafe, PayPal, PayZen, GoCardless) now
  exports a descriptor and implements `verifyCredentials`, and the conformance suite validates
  each descriptor against its adapter. Hosts can render provider-settings forms, validate
  credential shapes, drive webhook-subscription copy, build CSP headers, and offer a "Test
  connection" button as generic loops over the descriptor — identical for every adapter.

### Major Changes

- d68ccbb: Harden the adapter contract. Breaking: `capturePayment`, `cancelPayment`, and `verifyPaymentMethod` now REQUIRE an idempotency key (capture is the canonical double-charge operation; under multi-capture every partial capture carries its own key); `RefundRequest.reason` is typed to `"duplicate" | "fraudulent" | "requested_by_customer"`; capability guards reject with the new `unsupported_operation` code (previously `invalid_request`), expired stateless session tokens with the new `session_expired`; `authentication_required` is never retryable on any adapter; `withRetry`'s `maxDelayMs` is now a hard ceiling with jitter included.

  Additions: `AdapterCapabilities.supportedCurrencies` declares hard PSP currency constraints and the router/service pre-screen them (a PayPal-unsupported currency now skips to the next PSP instead of aborting the cascade); `PaymentInfo` reports `amountCaptured`, `amountCapturable`, and echoes `metadata` where the PSP supports it; `PaymentMethodDetails` carries `expMonth`/`expYear`; webhook events carry normalized `amount`, `currency`, and `refundId` where the payload does; `RetryPolicy.signal` cancels between attempts; new helpers `allocate` (lost-cent-free integer splits), `REFUND_STATUSES`/`RefundStatus`, `isUnifiedWebhookEventType`, `isUnifiedPaymentMethodType`, and the `DATA_PAYFANOUT_FIELD` slot constant.

  The conformance suite now proves the money paths on every adapter — retrieve truth, full/partial/over-refund behavior, pending-refund polling, capture and multi-capture amounts, clean cancellation, unknown-webhook mapping, per-code retryable semantics, and redirect-flow client adapters must implement `handleRedirectReturn`.

### Patch Changes

- 30d9a84: README refresh: correct the runner usage snippet to the real `(name, makeAdapter, fixtures)` signature, document the money-path coverage, and drop the stale "not yet published" notice.
- a016891: Adapter plumbing that existed as four-to-five drifting copies now lives once in `@payfanout/core`, and every adapter consumes it: the WebCrypto/base64 helper family (`hmacSha256`, `constantTimeEqual`, …, with the node:crypto bit-equivalence tests moved alongside), the REST transport primitives (`requestWithTimeout` with the timer covering the body read, `withTransportRetries`, `isTransportRetryable`, `safeJson`), the HTTP error tail (`classifyHttpFallback`), capability coherence (`validateAdapterCapabilities`, shared by `PaymentService` and the conformance suite), client SDK loading (`assertBrowser`, `injectScript`), and webhook utilities (`normalizeTime`, `lowercaseKeys`, `normalizeSecrets`). Behavior is unchanged apart from a few user-message strings converging on core's catalog text; all transport timing, retry, and edge-runtime guarantees are preserved and still guard-tested. Core remains zero-dependency and browser-safe.
